                        <p>The Traffic Light System is a basic yet fundamental project designed
                           to simulate the functioning of a traffic light using an Arduino board. 
                           This project is ideal for beginners to learn about the basics of electronics, 
                           programming, and the integration of hardware with software.</p>

                        <li>OBJECTIVE : </li>
                        <p>
                            The objective of this project is to control the flow of traffic at an intersection 
                            using a set of traffic lights and to mimic real-world traffic signal operations. 
                            The system will operate in a cycle, changing the lights in a sequence to manage 
                            the flow of traffic safely.

                        <p>The Wall-Detecting Self-Driving Car is a basic project designed to simulate an 
                            autonomous vehicle that can navigate its environment while avoiding obstacles, 
                            specifically walls. This project introduces students to the principles of robotics, sensors,
                             and basic programming.</p>

                        <li>OBJECTIVE :  </li>
                        <p>
                            The main goal of this project is to create a small car that can drive itself and 
                            stop or change direction when it detects a wall or obstacle in its path. This helps
                            demonstrate how self-driving cars can avoid accidents by sensing their surroundings.

                        <p>The Wrestling Robot is an exciting project that involves building a small robot using a
                            robot kit. The robot is designed to engage in a sumo-style wrestling match with another
                            robot, where the goal is to push the opponent out of a designated ring or area.</p>

                        <li>OBJECTIVE : </li>
                        <p>
                            The objective of this project is to create a robot that can sense its opponent 
                            and attempt to push it out of the ring while avoiding being pushed out itself. This involves 
                            programming the robot to detect obstacles (the other robot) and respond quickly with 
                            strategic movements.
